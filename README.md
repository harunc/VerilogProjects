# VerilogProjects
Verilog Projects and Homeworks. Homeworks shows better how we learned step by step. 
So if you want to see the process of my learning, I would recommend you to focus on them firstly.

# Homeworks
First one was basic design of gates and some adder substructors. It was for teaching modular design notion.

Second one was focused designing more complex systems like special purpose registers.

Third one was for implementing all the things that we have learned in a small scale.

# Projects
Project 1 was for designing an ALU system. In order to achieve this, we have designed special registers, an ALU and its tests.
It was a basic computer system working with memory.

In Project 2, we have written a control unit and simply we have designed our micro computer, which has memory and can take instruction set 
and do the instructions respectively.

HOPE YOU ENJOY!
